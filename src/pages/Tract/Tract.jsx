                  all they that had any sick with diverse
                  diseases brought them unto Him; 
                  and they that were possessed with devils;

                      Jesus exercised his supreme healing power to heal everyone who came to Him He could 
                      heal all those who came unto Him at that time because all of them had the power of 
                      receptivity and faith. Faith is the soil, and the power of God flowing through the healer is 
                      the seed. True healing requires the true soil of faith in the patient and the powerful seed of
                      healing in the healer or God.
       </p>       
       <p className='SecondP'>
                     Jesus could not heal everybody in the place where He was born because, even powerful as 
                     He was, He could not sprout the seed of his healing power on the rocky soil of disbelieving 
                     minds. 
       </p>          

       <p className='SecondP'>          
                    In healing, the power of the healer, great or small, is limited as compared to the unlimited 
                    healing power of God. Hence, all healers, instead of commanding their own powers in 
                    healing should invoke the unlimited Divine power of healing to flow through them and work 
                    certain healing. Man’s power may fail but God’s power can never fail. Even though God has 
                    unlimited healing power and though our Father does not want to see us suffer from 
                    disease, yet He cannot heal us until we open the gates of our own willingness to be healed. 
                    God has given us free choice, unlike the animals, and by misusing it we can keep God out 
                    of our lives. By using it properly, we can allow God to heal us. 
       </p>             
                    
       <p className='SecondP'>             
                    In order to be sure of God’s healing power, one must know and feel Him deeply in 
                    meditation daily. When sure of the Divine Communion, one should completely absorb 
                    oneself in God preceding every healing which one tries to perform. When administering 
                    Divine healing, the healer must act as a perfect medium in order to let God’s unlimited 
                    power flow through without obstruction. Egotism and loud declaration, and self-laudation, 
                    such as, “I healed her,” and so forth, should be strictly avoided both in speech and mind, in 
                    order to let the all-knowing God perform the healing.

        <h2>The Leading of The Holy Spirit</h2>
        <img className='image' src={img1} alt=""  />


        <p className='romans'>
          "So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the 
          flesh — 13 for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit
          you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14 For all who are being 
          led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 For you have not received a spirit of 
          slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by 
          which we cry out, ‘Abba! Father!’"
                <span className='Roman'>Romans 8:12-15:</span>
        </p>

        <p className='SecondP'>
          The context is clearly not talking about making decisions in non-moral issues. Paul is 
          talking here about righteous living. Paul is talking about following the Spirit’s leading to do 
          what God has commanded us to do in His word. When God refers here to leading us by 
          His Spirit, He’s not referring to giving us information in addition to what He’s given us in 
          His word. Rather, He is referring to the fact that He has sent His Spirit into our hearts to 
          incline us to do what He has commanded. And so He says, "Be led by the Spirit and not 
          by your sinful desires." The meaning of <span className='Roman'>Romans 8:14</span> is this: True sons of God are those 
          who are led by the Spirit of God to obey the word of God.
        </p>

        <p className='SecondP'>
         The same meaning of being led by the Spirit is found in <span className='Roman'>Galatians 5:18:</span> 
        "But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law."
        </p>

        <p className='SecondP'>
          Everyone is either under grace or under law. Christians are under grace. Everyone else is 
           under law. That is, they still stand under the law of God, and the judgment of God (for 
           their disobedience to the law) hangs over their heads. They haven’t yet come under 
           grace and received the forgiveness of Christ. And yet at times believers begin to act like 
           they are under law. But when they submit to the Spirit, doing deeds of righteousness, 
           instead of doing the sinful deeds of the flesh, they show by that that they are under 
           grace and not law. Once again, being led by the Spirit here means submitting to the 
           Spirit’s guidance to avoid the deeds of the flesh and walk in the way of righteousness. It 
           is very close to the notion of conscience. It is as if the Holy Spirit presses us to do what 
           we know we should do. And when we submit to that pressure we are following 
           the leading of the Holy Spirit. But these verses do not refer to what most Christians mean 
           today when they talk about being led by the Spirit. It does not refer to being led by the 
           Spirit in non-moral matters.
        </p>

        <p className='SecondP'>
          What is ‘being led by the Spirit’ being contrasted with in these two passages? 
          Being led by your own fleshly impulses. It is referring to the battle between flesh and Spirit: that 
          which is of the Spirit in us is in opposition with that which is of the flesh. In both contexts 
          Paul is saying, "Don’t follow the sinful desires of the flesh but follow what the Spirit wants 
          you to do, follow what the Spirit is moving you to do." This is what God also says in 
          <span className='Roman'> Ezekiel 36:27:</span> "I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and 
          you will be careful to observe My ordinances." The only times that the NT speaks of being 
          led by the Spirit, this is what it’s talking about.

        ...and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! But they cried out, Away with him, away with him,
         crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priest answered, We have no king but Caesar. 
         Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. And he bearing his cross went forth into a 
         place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, 
         and Jesus in the midst. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
